Parody site I built because of all the snake oil bs in the fitness industry. I have nothing against people using milk jugs at the gym, but I thought it would be a fun idea to build an e-commerce like site that played off something I though no one would try to market. Turns out I was wrong. There are actually bodybuilding sites selling 'custom' milk jugs to people which made this project bitter sweet.

Hope you enjoy it.
